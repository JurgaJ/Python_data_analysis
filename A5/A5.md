>> **TASK**
>>
>> Earthquakes and explosions present similar time-domain signals.
>> It is important to differentiate between these events.
>>
>> Data file exam/A5/ExplosionOrEarthquake.csv contains 16 recordings.
>> First 8 columns are seismic recordings of earthquake and the last 8 of
>> explosions.
>>
>>
>> Find:
>>
>> - The start time of the events.
>> - Frequency and power of the events.
>> - Duration of the events.
>> - Compare earthquakes with explosions.

>> **TASK**
>>
>> Recording consists of neural response to rapidly changing stimulus (~200 trials). 
>>
>> exam/A5/itpc.csv
>>
>> Find:
>> - Stimulus parameters (duration, frequency).
>> - Time and frequency range of maximum response.
>> - Time and frequency when maximum syncrony with the stimulus occurs.
