# >> **TASK**
# >>
# >> Earthquakes and explosions present similar time-domain signals.
# >> It is important to differentiate between these events.
# >>
# >> Data file exam/A5/ExplosionOrEarthquake.csv contains 16 recordings.
# >> First 8 columns are seismic recordings of earthquake and the last 8 of
# >> explosions.
# >>
# >>
# >> Find:
# >>
# >> - The start time of the events.
# >> - Frequency and power of the events.
# >> - Duration of the events.
# >> - Compare earthquakes with explosions.

# >> Recording consists of neural response to rapidly changing stimulus (~200 trials). 
# >>
# >> exam/A5/itpc.csv
# >>
# >> Find:
# >> - Stimulus parameters (duration, frequency).
# >> - Time and frequency range of maximum response.
# >> - Time and frequency when maximum syncrony with the stimulus occurs.
