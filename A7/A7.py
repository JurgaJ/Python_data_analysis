# >> **TASK**
# >>
# >> Microphones were placed in different locations.
# >> 8 recordings from different microphones placed in A7 directory.
# >>
# >> X1... X8.wav
# >>
# >> All microphones captured the same environment, but since they were in
# >> different locations the source-microphone distances are different.
# >>
# >> - Separate meaningful sources from the noise.
# >>
# >> - Plot the signals and their frequency compositions.

# To import sound `wavfile` from `scipy` can be used

from scipy.io import wavfile

# >> **TASK**
# >>
# >> EEG recordings capture post synaptic potentials generated by networks in the brain at different frequencies as well as noise from surroundings and other body parts.
# >>
# >> ![power](./powerBandsEEG.jpeg)
# >>
# >> The strength of each source in different EEG channels depend on their relative distance from each channel.
# >> Frontal channels are closer to eyes and we observe diminishing eyeblink amplitudes from frontal to ocipital channels.
# >> Ocipital channels contains more alpha (~12 Hz) brain activity. Line noise (50 Hz) is equally distributed accross all channels.
# >>
# >> - Simulate EEG recording. At least 6 channels from different locations. Signal must contain eye blinks, line noise, and brain activity.
# >> - Separate mixed simulated EEG recording back to sources.
# >> - Plot simulated and separated signals.

# >> **TASK**
# >>
# >> [Flow cytometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry) allows researchers to identify, serparate and characterise different cell types. 
# >> The detector and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) system converts analog measurements of forward-scattered light (FSC) and side-scattered light (SSC) as well as dye-specific fluorescence signals into digital signals that can be processed by a computer.
# >>
# >> ![flowcyt](./Cytometer.png)
# >>
# >> cyto.csv contains data from flow cytometer.
# >>
# >> FSCH/SSCH are measurements of the scattering.
# >> These parameters can be simplified as measures of a cell's size (FSCH) and a cell's internal complexity (SSCH).
# >>
# >> FL1_H ... are flourescence parameters. Different fluorochromes were used to distinguish subpopulations.
# >>
# >> Gate is the label given to each cell by the researcher.
# >> Two gates have been identified and labelled as 1 and 2. Noise labelled as -1.
# >>
# >> - Explore the dataset
# >> - Form a model to classify new data points as a particular gate.
